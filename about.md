# About

This site aims to be a reference repository about 0-day exploits that are
actively used in-the-wild. Since mid-2019, Project Zero has dedicated an effort
specifically to track, analyze, and learn from 0-days that are actively
exploited in-the-wild. Since 2014, Project Zero's mission has been to "make
0-day hard." From that came the goal of our in-the-wild program: "Learn from
0-days exploited in-the-wild in order to make 0-day hard."

One of the key aspects of our work has been to perform and publish root cause
analyses on each 0-day detected in-the-wild. For the last year, they have been
published on the [Google Project Zero
blog](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/rca.html), but we found that we wanted a
platform that better supports collaboration, history tracking, and updating. So
we've migrated here!

The goal is for this to be a database of information about exploited 0-days. We
invite pull requests for both new RCAs and updates/edits to existing ones.
Please check out the [Contributing page](contributing.html) for more info.
